                            <p><strong>Real-time strategy games (RTS) are a genre of video games where players control armies or factions in real-time, using a combination of resource management, base building, and tactical combat to achieve their objectives. Players typically start with a small base and must gather resources (such as minerals, food, or gold) to build structures and train units. They can then use these units to explore the game world, attack enemies, and defend their own base. In real-time strategy games, the action happens in real-time, which means that players must make quick decisions and respond rapidly to changing situations on the battlefield. Real-time strategy games can be played against the computer (in a single-player campaign or skirmish mode) or against other human players (in multiplayer matches).</strong></p>

                    <p>In addition to the new foliage features, UE5. 1 also includes new workflows for virtual production that make it even easier to create stunning content. The most exciting experimental feature in UE5. 1 is the ML-enhanced deformation system in the animation tools</p>
                
                    <h3>Ai vs. GPU</h3>
                    <iframe width="300" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tg332P3IfOU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>GPUs work by using a method called parallel processing, where multiple processors handle separate parts of the same task. GPUs are well known in PC (personal computer) gaming, allowing for smooth, high-quality graphics rendering.
                        <br />
                        Machine learning, a subset of AI, is the ability of computer systems to learn to make decisions and predictions from observations and data. A GPU is a specialized processing unit with enhanced mathematical computation capability, making it ideal for machine learning.
